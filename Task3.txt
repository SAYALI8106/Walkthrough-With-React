Explain the difference between npm and npx using the create-react-app code example.

->
The difference between npm and npx can be better understood by using the create-react-app example.


npm (Node Package Manager):

What it does: npm is used to install packages globally or locally. When you run a command like npm install <package-name>, it downloads the package and adds it to the node_modules folder in your project.
How you use it with create-react-app: If you install create-react-app using npm globally:
Code
npm install -g create-react-app

After installation, you can create a new React app using:
Code
create-react-app my-app
Here, create-react-app is globally available, so you can run the command directly. However, this requires keeping create-react-app updated manually and also takes up space globally.


npx (Node Package Execute):

What it does: npx allows you to execute packages without installing them globally. It temporarily downloads the package and runs it without saving it permanently to your machine.
How you use it with create-react-app: Using npx, you donâ€™t need to globally install create-react-app. Instead, you can run it directly:

Code
npx create-react-app my-app
This downloads the latest version of create-react-app, executes it, and then clears it from your machine. It's more convenient since you always get the latest version without managing global installs.


Key Difference in Usage:

npm: Requires installing create-react-app globally before using it, and you have to keep the tool updated manually.
npx: Allows you to run create-react-app directly without installing it globally, ensuring you're always using the latest version.
For a React project, using npx is the recommended approach because it's more efficient and reduces the need for global package management.
